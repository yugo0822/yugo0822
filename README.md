# Hi there, I'm Yugo Sudo! 👋

**Undergraduate Student at Kyoto University | Incoming Exchange Student at The University of Sydney**

I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student with a strong passion for **Control Theory** and **Machine Learning**.
My current research focuses on integrating Deep Operator Networks (**DeepONet**) with Model Predictive Path Integral (**MPPI**) control for complex dynamical systems.

Starting from **August 2026**, I will be joining the **University of Sydney** as an exchange student. I am actively looking for research opportunities and internships in Sydney where I can contribute with my skills in robotics, simulation, and software development.
